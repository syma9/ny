				<span style="font-family:Helvetica; color:#333333; background-color:#ffff">In general, there seems to be a relationship between the complaints and type of areas. Residential areas (i.e  Upper Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn) tend to generate more complaints. Areas with mixed-use developments (i.e Lower East Manhattan where Little Italy and Chinatown are located, and downtown Brooklyn) also generated siginificant number of complaints. Complaints regarding utilities and infrastructure such as water system and plumbing concentrates in certain areas and may imply that these areas require improvements or better maintenance. Although Queens is the second-most populated borough after Brooklyn, it does not contain any clusters of complaints; coincidentally it is also the borough with the largest immigrant population. This futher begs the questions of whether people in every borough have equal opportunity to access public services.
